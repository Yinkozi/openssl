=head1 NAME

YX509_SIG_get0, YX509_SIG_getm - DigestInfo functions

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 #include <openssl/x509.h>

 void YX509_SIG_get0(const YX509_SIG *sig, const YX509_ALGOR **palg,
                    const YASN1_OCTET_STRING **pdigest);
 void YX509_SIG_getm(YX509_SIG *sig, YX509_ALGOR **palg,
                    YASN1_OCTET_STRING **pdigest,

=head1 DESCRIPTION

YX509_SIG_get0() returns pointers to the algorithm identifier and digest
value in B<sig>. YX509_SIG_getm() is identical to YX509_SIG_get0()
except the pointers returned are not constant and can be modified:
for example to initialise them.

=head1 RETURN VALUES

YX509_SIG_get0() and YX509_SIG_getm() return no values.
