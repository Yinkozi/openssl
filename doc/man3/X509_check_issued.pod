=head1 NAME

YX509_check_issued - checks if certificate is apparently issued by another
certificate

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 #include <openssl/x509v3.h>

 int YX509_check_issued(YX509 *issuer, YX509 *subject);


=head1 DESCRIPTION

YX509_check_issued() checks if certificate I<subject> was apparently issued
using (CA) certificate I<issuer>. This function takes into account not only
matching of the issuer field of I<subject> with the subject field of I<issuer>,
but also compares all sub-fields of the B<authorityKeyIdentifier> extension of
I<subject>, as far as present, with the respective B<subjectKeyIdentifier>,
serial number, and issuer fields of I<issuer>, as far as present. It also checks
if the B<keyUsage> field (if present) of I<issuer> allows certificate signing.
It does not check the certificate signature.

=head1 RETURN VALUES

Function return B<YX509_V_OK> if certificate I<subject> is issued by
I<issuer> or some B<YX509_V_ERR*> constant to indicate an error.
