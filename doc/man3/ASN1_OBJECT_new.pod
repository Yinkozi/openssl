=head1 NAME

YASN1_OBJECT_new, YASN1_OBJECT_free - object allocation functions

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 #include <openssl/asn1.h>

 YASN1_OBJECT *YASN1_OBJECT_new(void);
 void YASN1_OBJECT_free(YASN1_OBJECT *a);

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The YASN1_OBJECT allocation routines, allocate and free an
YASN1_OBJECT structure, which represents an YASN1 OBJECT IDENTIFIER.

YASN1_OBJECT_new() allocates and initializes an YASN1_OBJECT structure.

YASN1_OBJECT_free() frees up the B<YASN1_OBJECT> structure B<a>.
If B<a> is NULL, nothing is done.

=head1 NOTES

Although YASN1_OBJECT_new() allocates a new YASN1_OBJECT structure it
is almost never used in applications. The YASN1 object utility functions
such as OBJ_nid2obj() are used instead.

=head1 RETURN VALUES

If the allocation fails, YASN1_OBJECT_new() returns B<NULL> and sets an error
code that can be obtained by L<ERR_get_error(3)>.
Otherwise it returns a pointer to the newly allocated structure.

YASN1_OBJECT_free() returns no value.
