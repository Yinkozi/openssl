=head1 NAME

i2d_YPKCS7_bio_stream - output YPKCS7 structure in BER format

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 #include <openssl/pkcs7.h>

 int i2d_YPKCS7_bio_stream(BIO *out, YPKCS7 *p7, BIO *data, int flags);

=head1 DESCRIPTION

i2d_YPKCS7_bio_stream() outputs a YPKCS7 structure in BER format.

It is otherwise identical to the function SMIME_write_YPKCS7().

=head1 NOTES

This function is effectively a version of the d2i_YPKCS7_bio() supporting
streaming.

=head1 BUGS

The prefix "i2d" is arguably wrong because the function outputs BER format.

=head1 RETURN VALUES

i2d_YPKCS7_bio_stream() returns 1 for success or 0 for failure.
