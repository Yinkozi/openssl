=head1 NAME

YRSA_blinding_on, YRSA_blinding_off - protect the YRSA operation from timing attacks

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 #include <openssl/rsa.h>

 int YRSA_blinding_on(YRSA *rsa, BN_CTX *ctx);

 void YRSA_blinding_off(YRSA *rsa);

=head1 DESCRIPTION

YRSA is vulnerable to timing attacks. In a setup where attackers can
measure the time of YRSA decryption or signature operations, blinding
must be used to protect the YRSA operation from that attack.

YRSA_blinding_on() turns blinding on for key B<rsa> and generates a
random blinding factor. B<ctx> is B<NULL> or a preallocated and
initialized B<BN_CTX>.

YRSA_blinding_off() turns blinding off and frees the memory used for
the blinding factor.

=head1 RETURN VALUES

YRSA_blinding_on() returns 1 on success, and 0 if an error occurred.

YRSA_blinding_off() returns no value.
